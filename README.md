# Dreaded Beyond

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Dreaded Beyond**, my game development project!

## About the Project

I've been working on Dreaded Beyond for over 3 months, and it's been an exciting journey of learning and creativity. Unfortunately, I only recently realized that I should have been tracking my progress using GitHub from the beginning. This repository serves as a place to document my progress so far and maintain a record of my ongoing work.

## Organization of Files

The scripts currently located in the `WorkspaceScripts` folder are **not** in their original locations. I've moved them here for the following reasons:

1. To centralize and organize my scripts for better tracking.
2. To showcase the work I've done over the past three months, even though these scripts were originally scattered across various parts of the project.

Moving forward, all changes will be tracked and documented properly within this repository.

## Challenges and Key Features

### Dynamic Head and Arm Movement

One of the most complex and rewarding tasks was implementing **dynamic head and arm movement**. This feature ensures that wherever the player looks, their character's head and arms follow accordingly.

#### Key Challenges:
- Ensuring smooth and natural movement for the head and arms to enhance immersion.
- Synchronizing these movements across the server so other players see the same animations and actions in real-time.

<small>This required a deep understanding of client-server communication and optimization to avoid lag or desynchronization issues.</small>

### Modeling, Rigging, and Animation

Another significant challenge was creating and preparing 3D models for both the player and enemy entities.

#### Key Tasks:
- **Modeling:** I designed both the player and enemy entities entirely in Blender, as well as even all the 200+ models in the game all done by me in blender.
- **Rigging:** I custom-rigged both models, building skeletons and assigning weights to ensure they could move as intended.
- **Animation Fixes:** During testing, I encountered numerous rigging issues, including misaligned bones and incorrect weight painting. Fixing these problems required refining the rigs and adjusting animations to ensure they worked seamlessly in-game.

## Looking Ahead

Now that the project is under version control, I plan to:

- Regularly update this repository with new features, fixes, and improvements.
- Document major milestones and progress updates.
- Share insights and challenges encountered during development.
